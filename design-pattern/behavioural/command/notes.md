Command pattern is an Object behavioral pattern that decouples sender and receiver by encapsulating a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undo-able operations. It can also be thought as an object oriented equivalent of call back method.

Call Back: It is a function that is registered to be called at later point of time based on user actions.
