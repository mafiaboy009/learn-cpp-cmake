The 'iterator' design pattern is used liberally within the STL for traversal of various containers. The full understanding of this will liberate a developer to create highly reusable and easily understandable data containers.

The basic idea of the iterator is that it permits the traversal of a container (like a pointer moving across an array). However, to get to the next element of a container, you need not know anything about how the container is constructed. This is the iterators job. By simply using the member functions provided by the iterator, you can move, in the intended order of the container, from the first element to the last element.
